Overview of C#
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET initiative.  It combines the computational power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic and is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications (via ASP.NET), mobile apps (Xamarin), games (Unity), and enterprise software. 

C# runs on the .NET runtime (CLR - Common Language Runtime), which provides services like memory management, security, and exception handling.  It's statically typed, supports strong typing, garbage collection, and includes modern features such as:

LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
Async/await for asynchronous programming
Generics
Delegates and events
Pattern matching
Records and nullable reference types
