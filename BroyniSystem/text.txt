Getting & Creating Projects
git init – Initialize a new local Git repository.
git clone <url> – Create a local copy of a remote repository (e.g., from GitHub). 
Basic Snapshotting (Staging & Committing)
git status – Check the status of files (modified, staged, untracked).
git add <file> – Stage a specific file for commit.
git add . or git add -A – Stage all changed files.
git commit -m "Message" – Commit staged changes with a message.
git commit -am "Message" – Stage and commit all tracked files in one step. 
Branching & Merging
git branch – List local branches (asterisk shows current branch).
git branch -a – List all local and remote branches.
git checkout -b <branch-name> – Create and switch to a new branch.
git switch <branch-name> – Switch to a different branch (modern alternative to checkout).
git merge <branch-name> – Merge a branch into the current branch.
git branch -d <branch-name> – Safely delete a local branch. 
Sharing & Updating Projects
git push origin <branch-name> – Push a branch to the remote repository.
git push -u origin <branch-name> – Push and set the upstream tracking (remembered branch).
git pull – Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
git remote add origin <url> – Link your local repo to a remote GitHub repo.
git remote set-url origin <url> – Update the remote repository URL (e.g., switch from HTTPS to SSH). 
Inspection & Comparison
git log – View commit history.
git log --oneline – Show a concise commit history.
git diff – Show changes between working directory and staging area.
git diff --staged – Show changes between staging area and last commit. 
Undoing Changes
git restore <file> – Discard local changes to a file (modern replacement for checkout --).
git reset --soft HEAD~1 – Undo last commit but keep changes staged.
git reset HEAD~1 – Undo last commit and move changes to working directory.
git revert <commit> – Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit (safe for public branches).
